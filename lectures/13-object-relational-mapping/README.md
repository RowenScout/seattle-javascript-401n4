## ORMs and ODMs
Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting relational database models to a programming language data-type using Object Oriented Programing. ORM librarys enable developers to use their programming language to control a database instead of using the database's native querie language. They can help developers write cleaner and safer code, by abstracting away the complexaties of database languages. Object Document Mapping (ODM) librarys function simular to ORM librarys but work with NoSQL databases that use document database models.
